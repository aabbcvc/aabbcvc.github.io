# The Korean Crypto Theft

In this blog we'll be exposing the Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs), analysing the infrastructure and tracing the funds of a threat actor that has targeted and successfully compromised cryptocurrency exchanges and companies.  Noteably, this threat actor showed proficency operating within AWS environments but also was observed leveraging simple CVEs for initial access. 

Whilst keeping victim companies anonymous, we will share the type data this threat actor stole to compromise crypto-exchanges, and who they may be trying to associate with the crimes they are commiting.

# How they get in

Although we will discuss interesting post-exploitation tradecraft later in the blog, with a threat actor successfully pillaging crypto-exchange AWS tenants, the initial access attempts we observed were not sophisticated nor novel. This is a reoccurring theme, even capable threat actors will go for the easy route in. 

## React2Shell

We observe this threat actor hased performed mass scanning to identify targets vulnerable to React2Shell:

```bash
cd react2shell-scanner
python3 scanner.py -l 22.txt -o ret22.json --waf-bypass
python3 scanner.py -l 23.txt -o ret23.json --waf-bypass
```

From the threat actors mistakes, we recovered files on disk that indicate that had successfully archived and exfiltrated source code from a victim organisation. From TOS of the exfiltrated source-code, we can see this is a "USDT staking" product with quite a few red-flags in the terms, however that is not the subject of this blog. The threat actors had compromised and exfiltrated the backend source code of a crypto "staking" platform. Additionally, we could see artefacts within the source-code that indicated this web-server was vulnerable and had already been exploited. 

CtrlAltIntel has previously blogged about [React2Shell exploitation in the wild](https://ctrlaltintel.com/threat%20research/React2Shell-Exploitation/), and within the source-code we code we saw similar malware delivered. This is evidence of **other** threat actors also exploiting this vulnerable webserver. Although not related to our group, we will briefly list the observed payloads within the source: 


| File                          | MD5                              | Context         |
|-------------------------------|----------------------------------|-----------------|
| hash                          | 8f633ade35df4f992eb28a2c5bc37cef | XMRig binary    |
| 5.sh                          | 42bd7c130c146246c88dc3462b0d21dd | XMRig installer |

[![1](/assets/images/err/6.png)](/assets/images/err/6.png){: .full}  


Within the `.env` file of this victim source-code we discovered environment variables set for `NEXT_PUBLIC_ADDRESS_PRIVATE_KEY`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_TRON_ADDRESS` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_TRON_PRIVATE_KEY`.

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_TRON_ADDRESS=THaYiraEQUzHg1ZqmYiuLyLGn7RoYwmFe5 
```

Noteably, we also found a Python script that used the `web3` library to retrieve a wallet balence with a private key. The same private key within the `.env` file was seen within the Python script. Looking at the [transactions](https://tronscan.org/#/address/THaYiraEQUzHg1ZqmYiuLyLGn7RoYwmFe5) on 11/12/2025 05:00 UTC, ~52.6 TRX was taken an sent to `TP7uWofWx5a6CcnHq7RpygRvKB5kTZGgPA` where it has not moved since. 

> Due to the timing of the transacation and timing of active React2Shell exploitation in the wild, we believe the TRX was likely stolen. We have no evidence the TRX was stolen by the threat actor discussed in the blog. The source code appeared to be archived and written to the disk 2 days later, so it may have been stolen by another actor, or potentially just moved by the organisation itself  

# The Amazon Kill Chain

This threat actor leveraged the AWS CLI in order to enumerate various services within the AWS tenant, including S3 buckets, Terraform, Kubernetes clusters, and databases. Having enumerated the environment, the threat actor moved laterally to a Kubernetes cluster - eventually dumping sensitive Docker images that relate to transfering and receiving cryptocurrency.

## AWS Background

AWS has a lot of services available that are interest to cybercriminals. We will briefly explain the role of each service we observed targeted - along with the reasons these are of interest to threat actors.

| **Service**                            | **Usage**                                                                                        | **Threat Actor Interest**                                                                                                                                                              |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Identity & Access Management (IAM)** | Manages users, roles, and permissions for AWS resources.                                         | Enables persistence and broad access across the AWS tenant; abused roles or overly permissive policies can allow full enumeration or lateral movement |
| **Simple Storage Service (S3)**        | Stores organisational data such as backups, configuration files, logs, and infrastructure state. | High-value target for credentials, secrets, private keys, source code, and infrastructure artefacts (e.g. Terraform state files) that enable further compromise and lateral movement.  |
| **Relational Database Service (RDS)**  | Provides managed relational databases (e.g. PostgreSQL, ...).                                  | Potential access to sensitive customer data, transaction records, authentication data, or application secrets                    |
| **Elastic Container Registry (ECR)**   | Stores private Docker container images used by applications and Kubernetes clusters.             | Provides access to proprietary application code, embedded secrets, API keys, and internal service logic that can be reverse engineered or reused in further attacks.                   |
| **Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)**   | Managed Kubernetes service for running containerised workloads.                                  | Offers a path to workload compromise, secret extraction, and access to internal services                       |
| **Lambda Functions**                   | Serverless compute used for tasks and automation                               | May expose hardcoded credentials, API tokens, or overly permissive IAM roles; functions can also be abused for stealthy persistence or data exfiltration.                              |


## Credential Validation & Initial Enumeration

After importing AWS credentials and tokens, the threat actor validated their initial access was successful and immediately attempted to enumerate databases and S3 buckets. We cannot confirm how they retrieved these credentials or tokens.  

```bash
aws sts get-caller-identity 
# Purpose: Validate the credentials / AWS tokens work 

aws s3 ls 
# Purpose: Enumerate S3 buckets

aws rds describe-db-instances --query "DBInstances[*].[DBInstanceIdentifier,Endpoint.Address,DBInstanceStatus,Engine]" --output table 
# Purpose: Enumerate RDS databases
```

One of the S3 resources must've taken interest to the threat actor, as they then began to recursively list it's contents. 

```bash
aws s3 ls s3://[REDACTED_AWS_RESOURCE] --recursive   # List contents of AWS resource
# Purpose: Recursively list all objects in the S3 bucket 
```

## S3 enumeration

AWS S3 buckets may contain credentials, keys, certificates or other interesting information for threat actors. The threat actor used `aws s3 ls` to list the files within the directory, using `grep` to target specific file names or extensions.  

```bash
aws s3 ls s3://[REDACTED_AWS_RESOURCE] --recursive | grep -i "kube"       
# Purpose: Identify Kubernetes config dirs ".kube" 

aws s3 ls s3://[REDACTED_AWS_RESOURCE] --recursive | grep -iE "\.pem|\.ppk|\.key"
# Purpose: Search for public/private key material

aws s3 ls s3://[REDACTED_AWS_RESOURCE] --recursive | grep -iE "\.pem|\.key|\.pub"
# Purpose: Search for public/private key material

aws s3 ls s3://[REDACTED_AWS_RESOURCE] --recursive | grep -vE "\.jpg|\.png|\.js|\.css|\.html" | grep -iE "env|config|secret|cred|pass"
# Purpose: Filter out legitimate files (.jpg/.png/...) and just look for sensitive files
```

### Terraform State File Hunting

Terraform is an Infrastructure-as-Code tool that companies deploy cloud resources quickly via configuration files - rather than through the AWS or Azure console for example. 

Having listed files, the threat actor looked at the specific `terraform.tfstate` file for inspection. `terraform.tfstate` is the memory of Terraform, containing mappings between Terraform resources in the configuration and real infrastructure objects, last-known values for your resources and general metadata. It may contain credentials for databases, names of AWS resources, API keys, IP addresses or more.

The threat actor used the command `aws s3 cp s3://[...REDACTED]` to copy these to SDOUT, where they used `grep` to search for interesting keywords like `password`, `admin`, `aws_db_instance`, or `aws_instance`. 

```bash
aws s3 cp s3://[REDACTED_AWS_RESOURCE]/terraform.tfstate - | grep -iE "password|master|admin|user"
aws s3 cp s3://[REDACTED_AWS_RESOURCE]/prod/eu-west-1/vpc/terraform.tfstate - | grep -iE "password|username|master|db_"
aws s3 cp s3://[REDACTED_AWS_RESOURCE]/prod/eu-west-1/vpc/terraform.tfstate - | grep -A 20 "\"resources\":"
aws s3 cp s3://[REDACTED_AWS_RESOURCE]/prod/eu-west-1/vpc/terraform.tfstate - | grep -A 50 "aws_db_instance"
aws s3 cp s3://[REDACTED_AWS_RESOURCE]/prod/eu-west-1/vpc/terraform.tfstate - | grep -iE "bastion|jump|public_ip"
aws s3 cp s3://[REDACTED_AWS_RESOURCE]/prod/eu-west-1/vpc/terraform.tfstate - | grep -A 30 "aws_instance"
aws s3 cp s3://[REDACTED_AWS_RESOURCE]/prod/eu-west-1/vpc/terraform.tfstate - | grep -iE "password|master_username|db_name"
aws s3 cp s3://[REDACTED_AWS_RESOURCE]/prod/eu-west-1/vpc/terraform.tfstate - | grep -A 20 "aws_instance" | grep -iE "public_ip|instance_id|tags"
aws s3 cp s3://[REDACTED_AWS_RESOURCE]/prod/eu-west-1/eks/terraform.tfstate - | python3 -m json.tool | grep -A 20 "outputs"
```

## Lambda Function Enumeration

Lambda functions are serverless code that runs in AWS. Threat actors target these as they may contain hardcoded secrets or have IAM roles attached:

```bash
aws lambda list-functions --region eu-west-1 --query "Functions[*].[FunctionName,Runtime]" --output table 
# Purpose: Enumerate all lambda functions

aws lambda get-function-configuration --function-name [LAMBDA_FUNC] --region eu-west-1                     
# Purpose: Inspecct function roles, configuration, environment variables Get function configuration

aws lambda get-function --function-name [LAMBDA_FUNC] --region eu-west-1 --query 'Code.Location' --output text 
# Purpose: Retrieve the function 
```

## Exposing infrastructure

Likely for lateral movement purposes, the threat actor attempted to make a network connection with an Amazon RDS, specifically connecting to expected port `5432`. Presumably this was unsuccessful as we quickly observed the threat actor enable this, making the AWS resource accessible to the internet. 

```bash
nc -zv [REDACTED_AWS_RESOURCE].rds.amazonaws.com 5432                                                  
# Purpose: Test network connectivity to a PostgreSQL RDS instance

aws ec2 describe-instances --region eu-west-1 --query "Reservations[*].Instances[*].[InstanceId,State.Name,PrivateIpAddress]" --output table
# Purpose: Enumerate EC2 instances for potential pivot points

aws rds modify-db-instance --db-instance-identifier [REDACTED_AWS_RESOURCE]     --publicly-accessible     --apply-immediately     --region eu-west-1
# Purpose: Expose the RDS instance to the public internet
```

## Container Enumeration and Exfiltration

### Elastic Container Registry

We observed the threat actor attempt to enumerate ECR repositries:

```bash
aws ecr describe-repositories
# Purpose: Attempt to enumerate ECR repositories (fails due to missing region)

aws iam list-attached-role-policies --role-name [REDACTED_AWS_ROLE] 
# Purpose: Verify IAM permissions associated with the compromised role

aws ecr describe-repositories --region eu-west-1  
# Purpose: List ECR repositories 
```

### Elastic Kubernetes Services

After listing the ECR repositories, the threat actor tried hard to use the AWS Elastic Kubernetes Services (EKS) to update the `kubeconfig` file in order to configure `kubectl` to authenticate via AWS IAM the Kubernetes cluster. 

```bash
aws eks update-kubeconfig                               # Missing parameters
aws eks update-kubeconfig --name [NAME1]                # Missing region
aws eks update-kubeconfig --name [NAME1] --region eu-west-1  # Failed?

aws eks describe-cluster                
aws eks list-clusters --region eu-west-1
# Purpose: Enumerating Kubernetes clusters 

aws eks update-kubeconfig --name [NAME2] --region eu-west-1
# Purpose: Successully authenticate kubectl to the victim 
```

After using the EKS `update-kubeconfig` command, the threat actor has succesfully could move to the Kubernetes cluster. Similar tradecraft was discussed in Wiz.io has previously blogged on similar [AWS -> Kubernetes lateral movement](https://www.wiz.io/blog/lateral-movement-risks-in-the-cloud-and-how-to-prevent-them-part-3-from-compromis).

### Kubernetes Lateral Movement 

Now the threat actor leveraged the `kubectl` to list pods running within the Kubernetes cluster:

```bash
./kubectl get pods --all-namespaces
# Purpose: Enumerate all running pods across the cluster

./kubectl get pods --all-namespaces --field-selector spec.nodeName=[AWS RESOURCE] 
# Purpose: Identify pods running on a specific Kubernetes node
```

### Docker Image Exfiltration 

After enumerating Kubernetes clusters and identifying pods of interest, the threat actor authenticated to ECR using AWS IAM credentials and proceeded to exfiltrate container images. These images contained proprietary cryptocurrency exchange code, secrets, and internal configuration data:

```bash
aws ecr get-login-password --region eu-west-1 | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin [DOCKER AWS RESOURCE] 
# Purpose: Authenticate Docker client to Amazon ECR using AWS IAM credentials

aws ecr describe-images --repository-name [ECR Repositry] -n [REDACTED] --region eu-west-1
# Purpose: Identify available container images and versions

./kubectl describe pod [REDACTED] -n [REDACTED]
# Purpose: Extract container image names (used for docker pull), tags, environment variables

docker pull [REDACTED].eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/[REDACTED_IMAGE]:v1.114.0.11
# Purpose: Download container image layers and metadata from ECR

docker export [REDACTED].eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/[REDACTED_IMAGE]:v1.114.0.11 -o [REDACTED_IMAGE].tar
# Purpose: Attempt to export the container image

docker save [REDACTED].eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/[REDACTED_IMAGE]:v1.114.0.11 > [REDACTED_IMAGE].tar
# Purpose: Package the container image into a portable archive for exfiltration
```

# Command & Control

From exposed infrastructure, we observed the threat actor leverage both VShell for C2 and FRP for persistent remote access. 

Although we didn't observe VShell victims, or it being active for long, FRP was configured and running on port `53`:

[![1](/assets/images/crypto/3.png)](/assets/images/crypto/3.png){: .full}  

Evidence suggests the threat actor started their licensed VShell server (4.9.3) on 23/01/26 04:22, configured to the port `8082`.

# Stolen data 

The threat actor primarily attempted to exfiltrate backend source-code, often containing hardcoded credentials. We observed this within the format of Next.js source code, but also saw Docker containers, and custom Java applications exfiltrated from victim organisations.    

The company chainup.com is a global blockchain technology and digital asset provider that has a wide variety of solutions. They offer centralized, decentralized and hybrid crypto-exchange software for finanical organisations or cryptocurrency companies. The threat actor had exfiltrated software developed by this company which contained hardcoded credentials to databases.

# Infrastructure

Noteably, all infrastructure used in the intrusion was based out of South Korea, with the main server for operating attacks on `64.176.226[.]36` - associated with the domain `itemnania[.]com` - registered in South Korea. 

To an uncareful eye, as the attacks are originating from servers within South Korea with the threat actors accessing this server from other IP addresses inside South Korea, one might think this group is South Korean. From the telemetry available, we could ascertain the adversaries accessed this server from IP addresses associated with FlyVPN - primarily on AS4766 (Korea Telecom), with few connections originating from AS45382 (Hostcenter) and AS46841 (FORKNETWORKING). This activity spanned from 10/11/2025 to 28/01/2026.
